# Aaron Ezra - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI. I have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI. These projects demonstrate my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.
