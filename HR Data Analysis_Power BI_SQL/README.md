**HR Analytics Dashboard: Analyzing Employee Churn**

**Goal**
The HR Analytics Dashboard project aims to identify the factors contributing to employee churn and provide actionable insights to reduce employee turnover rate, improve employee retention, and enhance overall organizational performance.

**Background Information**
The dataset includes information about employees in the company. It contains various attributes such as the employee's age, gender, job role, education, department, and marital status. Other information in the dataset includes the employee's daily rate, monthly income, training history, work experience, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. Additionally, the dataset includes a column for attrition, which indicates whether an employee has left the company or is still employed.

**Setup**
The first step in the project involved data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. This included removing any duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset. To facilitate better visualization of the data, I created age groups and ranges for monthly income. Furthermore, I verified that there was no missing data and that each field had the correct data type using Power BI's query tool.
